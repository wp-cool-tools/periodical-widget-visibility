The plugin is available in English, Spanish (Español) and German (Deutsch). It does not collect any personal data, so it is ready for EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use? =

1. Go to the Widget page in the WordPress backend. Every widget is enhanced by easy-to-use fields for time data.
2. Set comfortably the date and time definitions when to show or hide the widget.
3. After you have define the time data just save the widget settings. Done!

= Is there an option page? =

No. That is not neccessary. You set the visibility in each widget on the Widgets page in the backend.

= Do the scheduler settings effect cached pages? =

No. This plugin has no site effects to cache plugins. So it can happen that a cached page shows a widget although the scheduler settings says to hide it, and vice versa.

It is up to your cache settings how the visibility of a widget is considered. Maybe it is helpful to empty the cache automatically once a day.

= Does removing the plugin delete the settings in the database? =

Up to now: no. But you can remove the settings in the database easily with two possibilities:

* Either deactivate (uncheck) the visibility time scheduler in each widget and save the widget settings.
* Or remove the widget out of the widget area.

= Does the plugin work with Jetpack's Widget Visibility module? =

Yes. Both plugins work together perfectly and enhance each other to give you great control about when and where to display which widget.

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

The plugin is ready for right-to-left languages like Arabic or Hebrew.

All texts of the plugin are in the *.pot file. You would find the *.pot file in the 'languages' directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.
